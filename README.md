# Kids-Valentines-Day-Box

This is a quick and rather simple build I did for my son's 2nd-grade Valentine's party. While I love working on projects with my family, I typically would have not injected my hobby into his project but he was told by a friend that his Valentine's day box would never win any of the awards. My son is an amazing kid, I had to step in and provide some assistance to squelch the mean with love...hope this project is found useful or inspirational in some fashion by someone else.
