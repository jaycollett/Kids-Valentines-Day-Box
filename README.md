# Kids-Valentines-Day-Box
<img align="right" src="https://www.jaycollett.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/box-1.png" style="float: right;">
This is a quick and rather simple build I did for my son's 2nd-grade Valentine's party. While I love working on projects with my family, I typically would have not injected my hobby into his project but he was told by a friend that his Valentine's day box would never win any of the awards. My son is an amazing kid and incredibly smart, but his confidence can sometimes be lacking. After such an expirence, I had to step in and provide some assistance to squelch the mean with love...hope this project is found useful or inspirational in some fashion by someone else.
